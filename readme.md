# Godot MMD
This plugin allows you to import PMX models and VMD motions. Models are not converted to Godot native nodes.

This plugin is designed for recording videos, so it may not work with real-time gaming.

# Requirement
* Godot 4.2 .NET
* DotNet SDK 6.0 or above

# How to use
Get libbulletc.dll and copy it into project directory. For more information, see the [BulletSharp](https://github.com/AndresTraks/BulletSharpPInvoke) project.
